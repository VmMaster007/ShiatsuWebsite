              <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                I have Been Studying the human body and different forms of massage for over 20 years, 
                I specialized in shiatsu but I continue to study many forms of body work and blend them 
                into my sessions in order to get you the best results.
                I have worked for over 10 years full time in my own clinic and have become the local ‘go to guy’ 
                for back pain, sciatica, shoulder issues and many more. I have had the fortune to work with hundreds 
                of clients from various backgrounds including many professional sports men and women.
